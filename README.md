# Electrical-Fault-Classification-with-GAF-image

This repository contains the full content of electrical fault classification using two popular methods Machine Learning and Deep Learning

The first approach is to classify the electrical fault from the BUS voltage and current data using the Decision Tree Classifier

And in the second approach the same thing is done by by Deep Learning methon using Convolutional Neural Network
